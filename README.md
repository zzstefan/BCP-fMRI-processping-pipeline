# BCP-fMRI-processping-pipeline

The BCP fMRI data processing pipeline is in the form of a bash script. It is easy to run for someone with knowledge of the BASH scripting language. It is an infant-dedicated pipeline[1] which include the following steps: head-motion and distortion correction, infant-dedicated spatial registration, one-time resampling of fMRI data and individual independent component analysis (ICA)-based extensive denoising[2], similar to the state-of-the-art HCP pipeline.
